      <H2> The second program. </H2>
<P>
There is very little point in a program that outputs something but has 
no input. So for our second program we will use the command INPUT.
<P>
<code>
10 PRINT “Input first number “ <BR>
20 INPUT x <BR>
30 PRINT “Input second number” <BR>
40 INPUT y <BR>
50 PRINT “X + Y is”, x + y <BR>
</code>
<P>
INPUT will get two numbers that you type in the command prompt. 
It ignores any non-numeric characters, and translates the first 
number that you see.
</P>
The comma separates items to print, and also tells the computer to insert 
a space.
<P>
It is also possible to input strings of characters. To do this, we use 
what is called a “string variable”. A string variable always ends with 
the dollar character ($), and contains text rather than numbers.
<P>

<code>
10 PRINT “What is your name?” <BR>
20 INPUT n$ <BR>
30 PRINT “Hello”, n$ <BR>
</code>
<P>
When inputting a string, INPUT reads up to the newline (which it discards).
<P>
We can use the ‘+’ operator, but not any others, on string variables.
<P>
<code>
10 PRINT “What is your first name?” <BR>
20 INPUT fname$ <BR>
30 PRINT “What is your second name?” <BR>
40 INPUT sname$ <BR>
50 PRINT “Hello”, fname$ + sname$ <BR>
</code>
<P>
Notice that this program has a bug. The ‘+’ operator doesn’t insert a 
space, so unless you inadvertently added a space the program prints 
“FREDBLOGGS”. Try modifying the program by inserting a space between 
the two names.
<P>
