      <H2> The second program. </H2>
<P>
There is very little point in a program that outputs something but has 
no input. So for our second program we will use the command INPUT.
</P>
<P>
<code>
10 PRINT &quot;Input first number &quot; <BR>
20 INPUT x <BR>
30 PRINT &quot;Input second number &quot; <BR>
40 INPUT y <BR>
50 PRINT &quot;X + Y is&quot;, x + y <BR>
</code>
<P>
INPUT will get two numbers that you type in the command prompt. 
It ignores any non-numeric characters, and translates the first 
number that you see.
</P>
<P>
The comma separates items to print, and also tells the computer to insert 
a space.
</P>
<P>
It is also possible to input strings of characters. To do this, we use 
what is called a &quot;string variabl&quot;. A string variable always ends with
the dollar character ($), and contains text rather than numbers.
</P>
<P>
<code>
10 PRINT &quot;What is your name?&quot; <BR>
20 INPUT n$ <BR>
30 PRINT &quot;Hello&quot;, n$ <BR>
</code>
<P>
When inputting a string, INPUT reads up to the newline (which it discards).
</P>
<P>
We can use the &quot;+&quot; operator, but not any others, on string variables.
</P>
<P>
<code>
10 PRINT&quot;What is your first name?&quot; <BR>
20 INPUT fname$ <BR>
30 PRINT &quot;What is your second name?&quot; <BR>
40 INPUT sname$ <BR>
50 PRINT &quot;Hello&quot;, fname$ + sname$ <BR>
</code>
</P>
<P>
Notice that this program has a bug. The &quot;+&quot; operator doesn
&apos;t insert a
space, so unless you inadvertently added a space the program prints 
&quot;FREDBLOGGS&quot;. Try modifying the program by inserting a space between
the two names.
</P>
