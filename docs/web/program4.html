      <H2> The fourth program. </H2>

Programs often need to make branching decisions. In MiniBasic this 
is provided by the IF ... THEN statement.
<P>
<code>
10 REM Square root program. <BR>
20 PRINT “Enter a number” <BR>
30 INPUT x <BR>
40 REM Square root of negative is not allowed <BR>
50 IF x &lt 0 THEN 20 <BR>
60 PRINT “Square root of”, x, “is”, SQRT(x) <BR>
</code>
<P>
We have also introduced the REM statement. This simply adds comments 
to make the program easier for a human to understand. REM statements 
are ignored by the interpreter.
<P>

This program is actually not very effective. Really we should tell
 the user what is wrong. For this, we need the GOTO statement. A GOTO
  simply executes an unconditional jump.
<P>
<code>
10 REM Improved square root program <BR>
20 PRINT “Enter a number” <BR>
30 INPUT x <BR>
40 REM Prompt user if negative <BR>
50 IF x &gt= 0 THEN 80 <BR>
60 PRINT “Number may not be negative” <BR>
70 GOTO 30 <BR>
80 PRINT “Square root of ”, x, “is”, SQRT(x) <BR>
</code>
<P>
An IF ... THEN statement always takes a line number as an argument. 
This can be of the form IF x &lt y THEN b, as long as b holds a valid 
line number.
<P>
The operators recognised by the IF ... THEN statement are ‘=’, ‘&lt&gt’ 
(not equals), ‘&gt’, ‘&lt’, ‘&gt=’, ‘&lt=’.
<P>
We can also use AND and OR to build up complex tests
<P>
eg <BR>
<code>
IF age &gt= 18 AND age &lt 65 THEN x <BR>
</code>
<P>
Use parentheses to disambiguate lengthy tests. <BR> 
eg <BR>
<code>
IF age &gt= 18 AND (age &lt 65 OR job$ = “Caretaker”) <BR>
</code>
<P>
The IF ... THEN operators can also be applied to string variables. 
In this case the strings are ordered alphabetically.
