      <H2> The design of MiniBasic </H2>
<P>
MiniBasic is designed to allow non-programmers to add arbitrary 
functions to programs. Imagine we are attempting to SPAM-shield 
an email program. Different users have different ideas of what 
constitutes SPAM. By providing checkboxes we can go so far, but 
if a user want, say to, regard as SPAM everything with an attachment, 
unless it is under a certain size, unless it has come from a 
trusted list of addresses, then we are stuck. However by 
providing a MiniBasic interface, the user can input the relevant 
values and provide the logic.
</P>
<P>
The calling program would do this by setting up the input stream 
with, say, the email address of the sender, the title of the 
email, the length of any attachment.
</P>
<P>
The calling program then presents half of a MiniBasic program 
to the user, with the input set up <BR><BR>
e.g. <BR>
</P>
<code>
10 REM SPAM filter <BR>
20 REM sender&apos;s email <BR>
30 INPUT address$ <BR>
40 REM tile of email <BR>
50 INPUT title$ <BR>
60 REM length of attachment <BR>
70 INPUT attachlen <BR> 
80 REM PRINT &quot;&apos;Accept&apos; to accept the email or &apos;Reject&apos; to reject&quot; <BR>
</code>
<P>
The user then provides the logic for his choice.
</P>
<P>
MiniBasic can of course also be used as a stand-alone console 
programming language. This is useful for teaching purposes, for 
testing MiniBasic programs, or if you simply want to write a 
<I>filter</I> program that accepts from standard input and writes to
standard output.
</P>
<P>
It was important that MiniBasic be simple to learn, and simple to 
implement. For this reason the syntax of the language has been kept 
as close as possible to the type of BASIC used on microcomputers 
in the 1980s. Millions of people know a BASIC of this kind.
</P>
<P>
Because of advances in computer power since the 1980s array 
initialisation was allowed. This allows us to eliminate the 
difficult to use READ and DATA statements. Re-dimensioning 
of arrays was also allowed, largely for theoretical reasons 
(it turns MiniBasic into a Turing machine).
</P>
<P>
GOSUB was not included. It is not of much practical use without 
local variables and parameters, and a functional language isn&apos;t
very useful without some mechanism for passing and returning 
vectors. Adding these would have complicated the design of the 
interpreter considerably, and moved the language away from 
original BASIC.
</P>
<P>
PEEK and POKE are obviously hardware-dependent, add potential 
security risks, and were also not included.
</P>
<P>
The C-language source to MiniBasic is included. The interface is
</P>
<code>
int basic(const char *script, FILE *in, FILE *out, FILE *err)
</code>
<P>
In the standalone program these are called with stdin, stdout, stderr. 
In a component environment, these will usually be temporary memory 
files, and the input will be set up with the parameters to the function 
the user is to write.
</P>
<P>
The function returns 0 on success or non-zero on failure. 
</P>
<P>
The source code is portable ANSI C. With the exception of the CHR$() 
and ASCII() functions, which rely on the execution character set 
being ASCII. The relational operators for strings also call the 
function strcmp() internally, which may have implications on 
non-ASCII systems.
</P>
<P>
An interpreted language is obviously not a particularly efficient 
way of running functions. Variables are stored in linear lists, 
with an O(N) access time, so big programs are O(N*N). However 
because of the lack of support for subroutines MiniBasic is not 
very suitable for complex programs anyway. If you were to 
extend the scope of the program to run very large scripts, it 
would be necessary to replace the variable list with a hash table, 
binary tree, or other structure that supports fast searching. 
All MiniBasic keywords, with the exception of e, start with 
uppercase letters. This fact is exploited to allow faster 
recognition of identifiers starting with lower case. Users can 
use this feature to gain some performance advantage. 
</P>
<P>
On a fast computer the efficiency of MiniBasic shouldn&apos;t be a
major problem unless users run very processor-intensive scripts, 
or if the function is in a time-critical portion of code. In 
these cases the answer would be to move to a pseudo-compiler system, 
where the MiniBasic scripts are translated into an intermediate 
bytecode that is similar to machine language. This is a project 
for a later date.
</P>
<P>
Since MiniBasic is available as C source, it is possible to extend 
the language. Where possible extensions should be in the form of 
functions rather than new statements, to avoid changing the grammar 
of the language. To add a numerical function, foo, which takes a 
numerical and a string argument, write the function like this
</P>
<P>
foo - check the first character of a string  FOO(85, &quot;Useless function&quot;)
</P>
<code>
    
double foo(void)
{
  double answer;
  double x;
  char *str;
  int ch;

  match(FOO); /* match the token for the function */
  match(OPAREN); /*opening parenthesis */
  x = expr();    /* read the numerical argument */
  match(COMMA); /* comma separates arguments */
  str = stringexpr(); /* read the string argument */
  match(CPAREN); /* match close */
  if(str == NULL) /* computer can run out of memory */
  return 0;           /* stringexpr() will have signalled the error so no point in generating another */
  ch = integer(x); /* signal error if x isn&apos;t an integer */
  if( !isalpha(ch) )
    seterror(ERR_BADVALUE); /* signal an error of your if ch isn&apos;t  valid */

  if(str[0] == ch)         /* function logic */
    answer = 1.0;
  else
    answer = 2.0;

 free(str);               /* str is allocated with malloc(), so free */
 return answer;
}  

</code>
<P>
Once you have your function, add an identifier for it, FOO, to the 
token list. Then to the functions gettoken() and tokenlen() add the 
appropriate lines. Finally to the function factor() add the code 
for calling your function.
</P>
<P>
For string functions, the procedure is similar, except that they 
must return an allocated string. The convention is that they end 
with a dollar sign, and the token id ends with the sequence 
<I>STRING</I>. Add the call to the function stringexpr(), and add
your symbol to the function isstring() so that statements like 
PRINT know that it generates a string expression.
</P>
<P>
To change the input and output model, you need only change the 
functions doprint() and doinput(). If you wish to change the 
error system then you need to look at the functions setup(), 
reporterror() and the top-level function basic(). Currently 
the program takes FILE pointers, which should be flexible 
enough for most uses, but not if say you want to provide for 
interactive scripts.
