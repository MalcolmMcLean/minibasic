      MiniBasic is designed as a simple programming language, based on 
      BASIC. If you already know BASIC then you are well on your way to 
      learning MiniBasic, if you don’t then MiniBasic is one of the 
      simplest programming languages to learn.
      </P>

      MiniBasic programs are written in ASCII script. They are then 
      interpreted by the computer. This is in contrast to most “serious” 
      languages, which are compiled, that is, translated into machine 
      instructions and then run. Interpreted languages are slower than 
      compiled languages, but they have several advantages. One major 
      one is that they are portable – a MiniBasic script will run on 
      any computer that has a MiniBasic interpreter installed. Another
       advantage, especially for beginners, is that errors are much 
       easier to identify. Finally, MiniBasic is not really intended 
       as a standalone program, except for teaching purposes. It is 
       meant for incorporation into other products, where the user 
       is expected to provide functions in a general-purpose programming 
       language. An example might be a desk calculator which can be 
       extended to provide user-defined functions like the Fibonnaci 
       series, or an adventure game for which the user can design his 
       own levels. For technical reasons, this is much easier to 
       implement as an interpreted rather than a compiled language.
       </P>
       <P>
        One design goal of MiniBasic was that it should be easy to learn. 
        Millions of people already know some BASIC from school or through
       having a microcomputer in the 1980s. The second design goal was 
       that it should be easy to implement. The interpreter is written in
       portable ANSI C, and is freely available. It is in a single, 
       reasonable-length source, and is available for incorporation 
       into user programs.
       </P>
       <P>
       The final goal is that the interpreter should be what is 
       technically known as “Turing equivalent”. This means that it 
       is possible to implement any algorithm in MiniBasic. This 
       required one major extension to common Basic – the ability
       to redimension arrays.
       </P>
       <P>
       It is impossible to implement graphics commands in portable 
       ANSI C, so sound, graphics, and mice are not supported 
       in MiniBasic. Interaction with the user in the standalone
       model is via the console. However, where MiniBasic is
       incorporated into another program, generally there will
       not be direct interaction with the user. The caller will create 
       temporary files for input and output, fill an input stream, and
       pass it to the user-defined MiniBasic function for processing.
       </P>

       You can do virtually anything you like with this code, 
       including incorporating it into your own programs, or modifying
       as the basis for a scripting language of your own. It would be
       nice to be acknowledged but I don't insist on it - you can pretend
       that you created the program on your own if it makes your boss happy.
       The only thing you can't do is restrict my rights in the program
       in any way. So any derivative works or enhancements I can use as 
       I see fit.
