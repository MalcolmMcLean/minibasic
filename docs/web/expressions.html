      <H3> 1)	Expressions. </H3>

All expressions are evaluated using floating-point arithmetic. 
<P>
The + and – operators have lower precedence than *, / and MOD (modulus),
 which have equal precedence and are evaluated left to right. 
 ! (factorial) has the highest precedence. There is no exponentiation
  operator (use the POW() function instead).
<P>
There are two mathematical constants, e, Euler’s number, 2.71281828,
 and PI, 3.14159265.
<P>
It is possible to use variables or dimensioned variables in expressions. 
<P>
Typical expressions are <BR>
<BR>
10	- absolute value 10 <BR>
<BR>
x                    - value of variable  x <BR>
<BR> 
(x + y) * 2    - add x to y and multiply by two <BR>
<BR>
array(1,2)     - value of array element 1, 2 <BR>
<BR>
POW( x + y, 2) + array(1, LEN(A$))  - raise x + y to the power 2 and 
add an element of the array “array” given by 1 and  the length of A$.
<P>

MOD calculates the floating point modulus of a number. Both sides of the
 expression should be of the same sign. x MOD 0 is an error. Division
  by zero is also an error.
<P>
Floating point arithmetic is not exact, so expressions such as SQRT(2.0)
 * SQRT(2.0) may not be exactly whole numbers. Using the function 
 INT(x + 0.5) you can force an expression to be the nearest exact
  integer.
  <P>
 
Arrays are stored with the x dimension in the first column. This matters
 when initialising an 2d array with a list of values.
<P>

<code>
10 DIM a(4,4) = 1, 2, 3, 4, <BR>   
                       5, 6, 7, 8 <BR> 
                       9, 10, 11, 12, <BR>
                       13, 14, 15, 16 <BR>
</code>
will create an ascending list in a(x,y) order.
<P>
Array indices start from 1 and finish at the dimension size. 
Thus a(1,1) is the first element of the array, and a(4.4) the highest.
<P>
Note that there must be no space between an array name and the first 
parenthesis.
<P>
 
<H3> 2)	String expressions. </H3>
<P>
All strings are stored internally in ASCII format, as NUL-terminated 
arrays. Use of extremely large strings is likely to slow down the 
program, since most operations involve internal copying of strings.
<P>
A string literal consists of one or more concatenated quotes. A string 
can be spread over several lines, but the newline character is not 
allowed inside quotes. To enclose a quotation mark in astring, use double 
quotes.
<P>
<code>
10 LET A$ = “And God said “”Let there be light”” “ <BR>
    “and there was light.” “And God saw the light, that it was good.” <BR>
</code>
is an example of a legal string. Note that the start of the second line 
contains white space at the beginning to tell the interpreter it is a 
continuation of the previous line.
<P>
To add a newline or other control character, use the CHR$() function. 
Note that CHR$(0) will prematurely terminate the string. Use the ASCII() 
function to perform numerical manipulation on characters.
<P>

e.g <code> LET B$ = CHR$( ASCII(B$) + 1) </code> will set B$ to the next 
letter of the alphabet. 
<P>
The ‘+’ operator will concatenate strings.
<P>
<code>
10 PRINT  “Fred” + “Bloggs” + CHR$(42) + x$ <BR>
</code>
Will print FredBloggs* followed by the contents of x$ 
<BR>
Functions with names ending in ‘$’ always return strings. Parentheses 
are not optional.   
<BR>

<H3> 3)	Relational expressions. </H3>

Relational expressions are used only in IF ... THEN statements to 
make conditional jumps.
<P>
A relational expression evaluates to either true or false. The allowed 
operators a =, &lt&gt (doesn’t equal), &gt, &gt=, &lt, &lt=.
<P>
With expressions the comparison is numerical, and with strings it is 
alphabetical. Both sides of a relational operator must be of the same 
type.
<P>
Relational expressions can contain the keywords AND and OR. Order of 
evaluation is left to right, but parentheses should always be used to 
disambiguate mixed expressions.
<P>
Examples of use <BR>
<BR>
<code>
10 IF (x &lt= 5  AND x &gt 0) OR x = 10 THEN 100 <BR> 
</code>
