      <H2> The first program. </H2>
<P>
You are now ready to write your first program in MiniBasic. Traditionally,
 this is &quot;Hello World&quot;.
</P>
<P>
Firstly you need to install the MiniBasic interpreter. On a PC this is done by copying the executable MiniBasic.exe to your hard drive. Then you open a text editor and type
</P>
<P>
<code>
10 PRINT &quot;Hello World&quot; <BR>
</code>
</P>
<P>
Remember to terminate with a newline.
</P>
<P>
Save as &quot;Hello.mb&quot; (the extension is optional).
</P>
<P>
You then call the interpreter by typing &quot;MiniBasic Hello.mb&quot; in a
command prompt.
</P>
<P>
You should see the output <BR> 
Hello World <BR>
</P>
<P>
All MiniBasic programs have line numbers. Execution begins with the 
first line and ends with the last line. Lines must be in order and 
every statement must have a number. The number must be the first 
character in the line. However, we can spread long strings 
(sequences of characters) over several lines. This second program

<P>
<code>
10 PRINT &quot;In the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth&quot; <BR>
      &quot;and the Earth was without form and void &quot;
</code>
</P>
<P>
Will output a string too long to easily fit on one line. Note that 
the second line must begin with a space character, to indicate that 
it is a continuation of the first line.
