      <H2> The sixth program </H2>
<P>
It is possible to manipulate arrays of values just using IF ... THEN
 and GOTO, but it soon becomes very clumsy. For this reason MiniBasic
  includes FOR NEXT loops.
<P>
Say we want to print out an array
<P>
<code>
10 REM Prints the days of the month <BR>
20 DIM months$(12) = “Jan”, “Feb”, “Mar”, “Apr”, “May”, “Jun”, <BR>
                     Jul”, “Aug”, “Sep”, “Oct”, “Nov”, “Dec” <BR>
30 FOR I = 1 TO 12 <BR>
40 PRINT Month”, I, months$(I) <BR>
50 NEXT I <BR>
60 PRINT “Done” <BR>
</code>
<P>
FOR loops can be nested,
<P>
<code>
10 FOR I = 1 TO 8 <BR>
20   FOR J = 1 TO 8 <BR>
30   PRINT I, J <BR>
40   NEXT I <BR>
50 NEXT J <BR>
</code>
<P>
It is also possible to provide a STEP value other than one.
</P>
<code>
FOR I = 100 TO 0 STEP –2 <BR>
</code>
<P>
If you specify a null loop, such as FOR I = 10 TO 0, control will 
pass over the loop body and go to the next matching NEXT statement. 
The control variable must always be in the NEXT statement.
<P>
FOR ... TO loops can take complex expressions, such as FOR I = x TO x * x,
 in these cases the initial value, the end value, and the step value 
 are calculated once and then never modified.
<P>
FOR ... NEXT loops can be nested up to 32 deep. If you attempt to jump
 out of a loop then you are likely to trigger errors
<P>
<code>
10 REM Bad use of a for loop <BR>
20 LET X = 0 <BR>
30 FOR I = 1 TO 10 <BR>
40 INPUT Y <BR>
50 IF Y &lt 0 THEN 10 <BR>
60 NEXT I <BR>
</code>
<P>
However you may alter the counting variable within the loop. This can be
 used to force premature loop termination.
